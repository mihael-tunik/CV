\cventry{2017~--- 2019}{Master degree}{Saint-Petersburg}{Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University}{departament of applied mathematics and mechanics}{}

\subsection{Master thesis}
\cventry{2019}{Special kernel density estimator for finite sample size conditions}{}{}{}{}
Work is dedicated to research of theoretical accuracy of statistical kernel density estimator of special type for finite sample size conditions.

\section{Experience: 3 years 3 months}
\cventry{august 2019~--- now}{Saint-Petersburg State University, Chebyshev Laboratory}{engineer-researcher}{}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Work in team on development of special statistical instrument for geo-data analysis based on Gaussian Processes (multi-output GP, sparse GP) written mostly on Python language. Adding new features, refactoring of existing codebase. Research for relevant scientific articles in given subject area.\newline
\item Project work on software for solving inverse problems for seismic data. Developing specific approach based on previously developed software.
Using Tensorflow/Torch frameworks. Participation in development and testing on real data. \newline
\item Development of software for solving Riemann problems, which appear in porous media hydrodynamics.
Search for literature and articles, algorithm development and implementation. Created library on C++ for using in Python project via Ctypes. \newline
\item Fine-tuning advanced hydrodynamic simulations in Dumux with Bayesian Optimization technics, using botorch. In this project I took part in development of original algorithm and implementation. Also here I worked with experimental dashboards like Tensorboard and building custom UI for developed ML-system with PyQt5.
\end{itemize}
